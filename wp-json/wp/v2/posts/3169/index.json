A new python-based open-source software tool, DySTrack (Dynamic Sample Tracking), now joins recent efforts to change this by making smart microscopy more accessible on standard commercial microscopes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DySTrack, developed by Zimeng Wu, Jonas Hartmann, and colleagues at University College London, enables automated live tracking of moving samples without replacing existing acquisition software. Instead of re-engineering microscope control, DySTrack works in tandem with vendor software, allowing researchers to keep using familiar interfaces to configure acquisition settings while adding custom image analysis pipelines into the acquisition loop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a typical experiment, DySTrack continuously monitors high-speed prescans, runs user-defined python image analysis pipelines, and feeds the resulting coordinates back to the microscope to trigger stage movements and high-quality main scans. This loop allows automatic adjustment of the field of view to follow moving, drifting, or developing samples, reducing manual intervention and increasing experimental robustness.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DySTrack is designed to be lightweight and easy to adapt across different microscopes, avoiding vendor lock-in. Out-of-the-box integrations are provided for Zeiss LSM880 and LSM980 systems, as well as Nikon microscopes supporting JOBS, with support for further systems expected in future updates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help users get started, DySTrack includes example pipelines for several challenging biological applications, including tracking of the migrating zebrafish lateral line primordium and of the regressing chick Hensen&#8217;s node. These examples serve as templates that can be readily adapted to other organisms, samples and imaging setups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DySTrack is fully open-source, with comprehensive documentation and a modular design that encourages community contributions and experimentation. The developers position it as a low-barrier entry point for researchers and facilities interested in smart microscopy, particularly those who seek flexibility without committing to custom hardware or large software ecosystems. The tool is described in a recent bioRxiv preprint, and the code is available on GitHub.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With DySTrack, smart microscopy moves another step closer to becoming an everyday tool in the biologist&#8217;s increasingly automated tool belt.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-base-color has-light-blue-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-462b5980ad7b88e11f35a0bb92851dcf\" style=\"padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--20);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--20);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-container-core-group-is-layout-26f58b4f wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-cfc1229d547209fd523665ae8d1c3e35\">More information:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The code is freely available on GitHub (<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/WhoIsJack\/DySTrack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/github.com\/WhoIsJack\/DySTrack<\/a>) and a comprehensive documentation can be found online (<a href=\"https:\/\/whoisjack.github.io\/DySTrack\">https:\/\/whoisjack.github.io\/DySTrack<\/a>).
